# How to solve TSP?
Implementation of Evolutionary Algorithm to solve famous Travelling Salesman Problem.
The code:
* was written for Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computing course at KU Leuven, 2020. 
* was considered among Top-15 percent best implementations for the competition among ~100 students.
* was implemented to solve large TSP tasks (~1000 cities) within 5 minutes timeframe.

## Experiments content
* data - directory containing two example datasets which include 29 and 100 cities
* solver - directory containing EA implementation and Reporter class.  
* result - directory containing solutions. 

## Requirements
```
numpy-1.19.2
python-3.7.10
```

## Usage
After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and start the algorithm for one of the example datasets:
```bash
python main.py
```
